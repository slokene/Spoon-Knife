Li";A Theory and Evidence-Based Artificial Intelligence-Driven Motivational Digital Assistant to Decrease Vaccine Hesitancy: Intervention Development and Validation;Vaccines (Basel);2024;12;7;;Vaccine hesitancy is one of the top ten threats to global health. Artificial intelligence-driven chatbots and motivational interviewing skills show promise in addressing vaccine hesitancy. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence-driven motivational digital assistant in decreasing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Hong Kong adults. The intervention development and validation were guided by the Medical Research Council's framework with four major steps: logic model development based on theory and qualitative interviews (n = 15), digital assistant development, expert evaluation (n = 5), and a pilot test (n = 12). The Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix model and qualitative findings guided the development of the intervention logic model and content with five web-based modules. An artificial intelligence-driven chatbot tailored to each module was embedded in the website to motivate vaccination intention using motivational interviewing skills. The content validity index from expert evaluation was 0.85. The pilot test showed significant improvements in vaccine-related health literacy (p = 0.021) and vaccine confidence (p = 0.027). This digital assistant is effective in improving COVID-19 vaccine literacy and confidence through valid educational content and motivational conversations. The intervention is ready for testing in a randomized controlled trial and has high potential to be a useful toolkit for addressing ambivalence and facilitating informed decision making regarding vaccination.;10.3390/vaccines12070708

Li";Mapping the transmission risk of Zika virus using machine learning models;Acta Trop;2018;185;;391–399;Zika virus, which has been linked to severe congenital abnormalities, is exacerbating global public health problems with its rapid transnational expansion fueled by increased global travel and trade. Suitability mapping of the transmission risk of Zika virus is essential for drafting public health plans and disease control strategies, which are especially important in areas where medical resources are relatively scarce. Predicting the risk of Zika virus outbreak has been studied in recent years, but the published literature rarely includes multiple model comparisons or predictive uncertainty analysis. Here, three relatively popular machine learning models including backward propagation neural network (BPNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF) were adopted to map the probability of Zika epidemic outbreak at the global level, pairing high-dimensional multidisciplinary covariate layers with comprehensive location data on recorded Zika virus infection in humans. The results show that the predicted high-risk areas for Zika transmission are concentrated in four regions: Southeastern North America, Eastern South America, Central Africa and Eastern Asia. To evaluate the performance of machine learning models, the 50 modeling processes were conducted based on a training dataset. The BPNN model obtained the highest predictive accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.965-0.967], followed by the GBM model (10-fold cross-validation AUC?=?0.964[0.963-0.965]) and the RF model (10-fold cross-validation AUC?=?0.963[0.962-0.964]). Based on training samples, compared with the BPNN-based model, we find that significant differences (p?=?0.0258* and p?=?0.0001***, respectively) are observed for prediction accuracies achieved by the GBM and RF models. Importantly, the prediction uncertainty introduced by the selection of absence data was quantified and could provide more accurate fundamental and scientific information for further study on disease transmission prediction and risk assessment.;10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.06.021

The dataset was randomly divided into training and testing sets, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for testing. After training the models, the testing data were used to evaluate their performance. This evaluation measured the models’ ability to generalise to unseen data using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC.Results Approximately 7.45% of children (95%?CI 6.73%, 8.65%) were categorised as zero-dose children. The RF classifier achieved the highest performance metrics among the evaluated algorithms, with accuracy=0.95, precision=0.94, recall=0.96, F1 score=0.95 and AUC=0.99, making it the most effective supervised machine learning method for predicting zero-dose children in Tanzania. Maternal unemployment had the most significant positive impact (+0.060) on predicting zero-dose children. Lack of maternal education was the second most significant positive factor (+0.048), indicating that mothers without formal education are more likely to have zero-dose children. Small family size was the third most influential factor, with a positive effect (+0.040) on predicting zero-dose children in Tanzania.Conclusions The RF classifier emerged as the top-performing model for predicting children in Tanzania who have not received any vaccinations. This comprehensive approach enabled the accurate identification of zero-dose children, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing public health initiatives and optimising vaccination strategies. Using this algorithm can enhance health outcomes and reduce the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases in Tanzania.Data are available in a public, open access repository.

M. A. Alemayehu;Machine learning algorithms for prediction of measles one vaccination dropout among 12-23 months children in Ethiopia;BMJ Open;2024;14;11;e089764;INTRODUCTION: Despite the availability of a safe and effective measles vaccine in Ethiopia, the country has experienced recurrent and significant measles outbreaks, with a nearly fivefold increase in confirmed cases from 2021 to 2023. The WHO has identified being unvaccinated against measles as a major factor driving this resurgence of cases and deaths. Consequently, this study aimed to apply robust machine learning algorithms to predict the key factors contributing to measles vaccination dropout. METHODS: This study utilised data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey to evaluate measles vaccination dropout. Eight supervised machine learning algorithms were implemented: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression. Data preprocessing and model development were performed using R language V.4.2.1. The predictive models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and area under the curve (AUC). Unlike previous studies, this research utilised Shapley values to interpret individual predictions made by the top-performing machine learning model. RESULTS: The XGBoost algorithm surpassed all classifiers in predicting measles vaccination dropout (Accuracy and AUC values of 73.9% and 0.813, respectively). The Shapley Beeswarm plot displayed how each feature influenced the best model's predictions. The model predicted that the younger mother's age, religion-Jehovah/Adventist, husband with no and mother with primary education, unemployment of the mother, residence in the Oromia and Somali regions, large family size and older paternal age have a strong positive impact on the measles vaccination dropout. CONCLUSION: The measles dropout rate in the country exceeded the recommended threshold of <10%. To tackle this issue, targeted interventions are crucial. Public awareness campaigns, regular health education and partnerships with religious institutions and health extension workers should be implemented, particularly in the identified underprivileged regions. These measures can help reduce measles vaccination dropout rates and enhance overall coverage.;10.1136/bmjopen-2024-089764

"Laila Rasmy; Yang Xiang; Ziqian Xie; Cui Tao; Degui Zhi";Med-BERT: pretrained contextualized embeddings on large-scale structured electronic health records for disease prediction;npj Digital Medicine;2021;4;1;86;Deep learning (DL)-based predictive models from electronic health records (EHRs) deliver impressive performance in many clinical tasks. Large training cohorts, however, are often required by these models to achieve high accuracy, hindering the adoption of DL-based models in scenarios with limited training data. Recently, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and related models have achieved tremendous successes in the natural language processing domain. The pretraining of BERT on a very large training corpus generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models trained on smaller datasets. Inspired by BERT, we propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT framework originally developed for the text domain to the structured EHR domain. Med-BERT is a contextualized embedding model pretrained on a structured EHR dataset of 28,490,650 patients. Fine-tuning experiments showed that Med-BERT substantially improves the prediction accuracy, boosting the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by 1.21–6.14% in two disease prediction tasks from two clinical databases. In particular, pretrained Med-BERT obtains promising performances on tasks with small fine-tuning training sets and can boost the AUC by more than 20% or obtain an AUC as high as a model trained on a training set ten times larger, compared with deep learning models without Med-BERT. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease prediction studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses, and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare.;10.1038/s41746-021-00455-y

A comprehensive framework for disease management must fully connect the complete disease lifecycle, including emergence from reservoir populations, zoonotic vector transmission, and impact on human societies. The Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis is a software environment and conceptual architecture for data integration, situational awareness, visualization, prediction, and intervention assessment. Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis automatically collects biosurveillance data using natural language processing, integrates structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, applies advanced machine learning, and uses multi-modeling for analyzing disease dynamics and testing interventions in complex, heterogeneous populations. In the illustrative case studies, natural language processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness. Classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and boosting) were used for disease predictions.;10.1177/1460458217747112

A state of health emergency was declared in 2022 due to Clade 2 of the monkeypox (MPOX) virus. In August 2024, another emergency was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of the widespread Clade 1b, which caused a more severe and lethal disease. This review synthesizes current MPOX knowledge to assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in developing effective diagnostics, therapeutic interventions, vaccination strategies, and outbreak management. Methods: This systematic review study searched for articles on virus epidemiology, virology, clinical features, transmission routes, available drugs and vaccines, and new artificial intelligence (AI) applications in diagnosis and drug discovery. Results: MPOX virus is a 200-250-nm, double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) virus that causes smallpox-like skin lesions. Tecovirimat is the primary drug for severe cases, especially in people with suppressed immune systems. Smallpox vaccines can help prevent MPOX infection because of the genetic similarities between the MPOX and smallpox viruses. AI-based models can assist medical teams in promptly diagnosing MPOX skin lesions, improving decision-making for treatment. Conclusion: This review highlights the importance of using traditional public health knowledge alongside modern AI to manage MPOX outbreaks effectively. It shows that we need strong public health policies, focused interventions, and ongoing research on how AI can help control infectious diseases.;10.1155/jotm/6688914

Morquin";Artificial intelligence and infectious diseases: Scope and perspectives;Infectious Diseases Now;2025;55;7;105131;Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to permeate every facet of infectious disease practice—from prevention and public health surveillance to epidemic management and bedside care. Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify—and localize—virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient’s bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks. Rigorous, lifecycle-based evaluation frameworks—covering external validation, cost-effectiveness analysis, and post-deployment monitoring—are required to ensure safe, equitable, and sustainable AI adoption. This review synthesizes current applications, evidential strengths, and unresolved challenges, and proposes a translational roadmap aligning technical innovation with clinical and regulatory realities.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2025.105131

Traditional epidemiological tools are being significantly complemented by recent innovations especially using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. AI-based model systems could improve pattern recognition of disease spread in populations and predictions of outbreaks in different geographical locations. A variable and a minimal amount of data are available for the signs and symptoms of Covid-19, allowing a composite of maximum likelihood algorithms to be employed to enhance the accuracy of disease diagnosis and to identify potential drugs. AI-based forecasting and predictions are expected to complement traditional approaches by helping public health officials to select better response and preparedness measures against Covid-19 cases. AI-based approaches have helped address the key issues but a significant impact on the global healthcare industry is yet to be achieved. The capability of AI to address the challenges may make it a key player in the operation of healthcare systems in future.

The transmission of this virus has infected more than 18.92 million people as of August 6, 2020, with over half a million deaths across the globe; the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this a global pandemic. A multidisciplinary approach needs to be followed for diagnosis, treatment and tracking, especially between medical and computer sciences, so, a common ground is available to facilitate the research work at a faster pace. With this in mind, this survey paper aimed to explore and understand how and which different technological tools and techniques have been used within the context of COVID-19. The primary contribution of this paper is in its collation of the current state-of-the-art technological approaches applied to the context of COVID-19, and doing this in a holistic way, covering multiple disciplines and different perspectives.

The rise of resistant microorganisms undermines the effectiveness of antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and other antimicrobial agents, leading to increased mortality, prolonged illnesses, and escalating medical costs. This study underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions, focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to combat AMR. AI, with its rapid data processing, predictive modeling capabilities, and cost-effectiveness, emerges as a transformative tool in mitigating this global crisis. AI-driven predictive models have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in identifying AMR patterns by analyzing vast datasets encompassing patient demographics, antibiotic usage, and environmental factors. These models enhance the precision of antibiotic therapy, guide antimicrobial stewardship programs, and provide early warnings for resistance outbreaks. Furthermore, AI facilitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents, accelerates drug discovery, and supports precision medicine by tailoring treatments to individual patients' profiles. The effective application of AI in addressing AMR necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, microbiologists, policymakers, and AI specialists. This paper calls for robust policy frameworks, dedicated funding, and global partnerships to integrate AI into healthcare systems for AMR surveillance, prevention, and control. Embracing AI innovation is pivotal to safeguarding global public health and ensuring a sustainable future free from the threat of antimicrobial resistance.;10.1186/s44398-025-00001-w

Recently, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Statement on AMR defined targets for addressing the impact of resistance on human, animal, and environmental health. For human health, the discovery and development of new antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship programmes, antimicrobial surveillance, and infection control and prevention are all key areas. Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally placed to help achieve the UNGA targets via its role in revealing patterns in data that are clinically indiscernible, and using that information to build clinical decision support systems. However, significant barriers remain in terms of necessary infrastructure, know-how, and the implementation of AI approaches. In this Series paper, we consider the potential applications of AI in combatting the AMR problem through drug discovery and development, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostics, and surveillance, and their use in public health.

Machine learning-based early warning systems may reduce the time to recognition, but few systems have undergone clinical evaluation. In this prospective, multi-site cohort study, we examined the association between patient outcomes and provider interaction with a deployed sepsis alert system called the Targeted Real-time Early Warning System (TREWS). During the study, 590,736 patients were monitored by TREWS across five hospitals. We focused our analysis on 6,877 patients with sepsis who were identified by the alert before initiation of antibiotic therapy. Adjusting for patient presentation and severity, patients in this group whose alert was confirmed by a provider within 3?h of the alert had a reduced in-hospital mortality rate (3.3%, confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 5.1%, adjusted absolute reduction, and 18.7%, CI 9.4, 27.0%, adjusted relative reduction), organ failure and length of stay compared with patients whose alert was not confirmed by a provider within 3?h. Improvements in mortality rate (4.5%, CI 0.8, 8.3%, adjusted absolute reduction) and organ failure were larger among those patients who were additionally flagged as high risk. Our findings indicate that early warning systems have the potential to identify sepsis patients early and improve patient outcomes and that sepsis patients who would benefit the most from early treatment can be identified and prioritized at the time of the alert.;10.1038/s41591-022-01894-0

A further crisis has manifested mass fear and panic, driven by lack of information, or sometimes outright misinformation, alongside the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter is one of the prominent and trusted social media in this current outbreak. Over time, boundless COVID-19 headlines and vast awareness have been spreading, with tweets, updates, videos, and explosive posts. Few studies have been performed on the pandemic to detect and interrelate various disease types, including current coronavirus. However, it is pretty tricky to discriminate and detect a specific category. This work is motivated by the need to inform society about limiting irrelevant information and avoiding spreading negative emotions. In this context, the current work focuses on informative tweet detection in the pandemic to provide relevant information to the government, medical organizations, victims services, etc. This paper used a Majority Voting technique-based Ensemble Deep Learning (MVEDL) model.

METHODS: Here, we developed a machine learning method based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Large Language Models (LLM) to predict COVID-19 diagnosis solely based on text descriptions of acute changes in chemosensation, i.e., smell, taste and chemesthesis, caused by the disease. The dataset of more than 1500 subjects was obtained from survey responses early in the COVID-19 pandemic, in Spring 2020. RESULTS: When predicting COVID-19 diagnosis, our NLP model performs comparably (AUC ROC?~?0.65) to models based on self-reported changes in function collected via quantitative rating scales. Further, our NLP model could attribute importance of words when performing the prediction; sentiment and descriptive words such as smell"", ""taste"", ""sense"", had strong contributions to the predictions. In addition, adjectives describing specific tastes or smells such as ""salty"", ""sweet"", ""spicy"", and ""sour"" also contributed considerably to predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the description of perceptual symptoms caused by a viral infection can be used to fine-tune an LLM model to correctly predict and interpret the diagnostic status of a subject.

Holmes";Artificial intelligence and infectious disease diagnostics: state of the art and future perspectives;Lancet Infect Dis;2025;;;;Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.;10.1016/s1473-3099(25)00354-8

We provide an overview of AI’s current and prospective uses, as well as how it relates to clinical infection control. Research studies, Clinical trial, and meta-analytic received precedence when screening 1617 the PubMed database findings. The review’s narrative format centres on investigations that employ clinically validated prospectively acquired data from the real world, as well as studies with transformative possibility, including unique pharmaceutical discovery and microbiome-based interventions. Clinical imaging analysis (e.g., tuberculosis of the lungs diagnosis), tools for clinical decision-support (e.g., antimicrobial recommending, sepsis prediction), digital culture plate reading, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and malaria diagnosis are a few areas where there is proof to support the medical value of artificial intelligence (AI) used for diagnostics in laboratories. To date, most studies have not included medical metrics or real-world validation. Comparability is hampered by substantial variation in research methodology and reports. There are a lot of practical and ethical concerns, such as bias risk and algorithm transparency. Though the practical medical value of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for infections investigation and control seems to be much more modest, enthusiasm for the research and creation of these tools is certainly gaining momentum.;

This systematic review aims to explore the evidence on the use of AI and digital health in improving primary health care service delivery. METHODS: Three electronic databases were searched using a comprehensive search strategy without providing any restriction in June 2023. Retrieved articles were screened independently using the Rayyan"" software. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two review authors. A narrative synthesis of the included interventions was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 4596 articles were screened, and finally, 48 articles were included from 21 different countries published between 2013 and 2021. The main focus of the included studies was noncommunicable diseases (n = 15), maternal and child health care (n = 11), primary care (n = 8), infectious diseases including tuberculosis, leprosy, and HIV (n = 7), and mental health (n = 6). Included studies considered interventions using AI, and digital health of which mobile-phone-based interventions were prominent. m-health interventions were well adopted and easy to use and improved the record-keeping, service deliver, and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: AI and the application of digital technologies improve primary health care service delivery in resource-poor settings in various ways. However, in most of the cases, the application of AI and digital health is implemented through m-health. There is a great scope to conduct further research exploring the interventions on a large scale.""";10.1111/jebm.12547

Combining whole-genome sequencing of 1113 pre- and posttreatment bacterial isolates with machine-learning analysis of 140,349 urinary tract infections and 7365 wound infections, we found that treatment-induced emergence of resistance could be predicted and minimized at the individual-patient level. Emergence of resistance was common and driven not by de novo resistance evolution but by rapid reinfection with a different strain resistant to the prescribed antibiotic. As most infections are seeded from a patient's own microbiota, these resistance-gaining recurrences can be predicted using the patient's past infection history and minimized by machine learning-personalized antibiotic recommendations, offering a means to reduce the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.;10.1126/science.abg9868

In this paper, we focus on the epistemological issues arising from the development and implementation of a class of AI for clinical practice, namely clinical decision support systems (CDSS). We will first provide an overview of the epistemic tasks of medical professionals, and then analyse which of these tasks can be supported by CDSS, while also explaining why some of them should remain the territory of human experts. Clinical decision making involves a reasoning process in which clinicians combine different types of information into a coherent and adequate ‘picture of the patient’ that enables them to draw explainable and justifiable conclusions for which they bear epistemological responsibility. Therefore, we suggest that it is more appropriate to think of a CDSS as clinical reasoning support systems (CRSS). Developing CRSS that support clinicians' reasoning process therefore requires that: (a) CRSSs are developed on the basis of relevant and well-processed data; and (b) the system facilitates an interaction with the clinician. Therefore, medical experts must collaborate closely with AI experts developing the CRSS. In addition, responsible use of an CRSS requires that the data generated by the CRSS is empirically justified through an empirical link with the individual patient. In practice, this means that the system indicates what factors contributed to arriving at an advice, allowing the user (clinician) to evaluate whether these factors are medically plausible and applicable to the patient. Finally, we defend that proper implementation of CRSS allows combining human and artificial intelligence into hybrid intelligence, were both perform clearly delineated and complementary empirical tasks. Whereas CRSSs can assist with statistical reasoning and finding patterns in complex data, it is the clinicians' task to interpret, integrate and contextualize.";https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13541

During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI tools were utilized for contact tracing, automated screening, drug repurposing, severity prediction, and disease spread modeling. AI’s use in epidemiology includes predictive modeling for infectious disease outbreaks, surveillance, and genomic analysis, which during the COVID-19 pandemic, aided in identifying variants of SARS-CoV-2. In the area of genomics, AI is used to track mutations in pathogens, and in non-communicable diseases like cancer. AI is also used in environmental health to analyze climate data that impacts disease outbreaks. However, despite all the benefits AI brings to public health, there are challenges such as data privacy and ethical considerations that require thoughtful integration of policies into public health systems to maximize benefits, while mitigating risks.;10.1007/978-3-031-83526-1_9
"J. Kaur; Z. A.

The growing frequency of emerging infectious diseases highlights the urgency for more rapid and accurate surveillance methods. This perspective proposes a forward-looking conceptual framework for AI-driven epidemic intelligence, emphasizing the transformative potential of integrating large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and optimization-based resource allocation strategies. While existing AI-driven systems have shown significant capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, several challenges remain, including real-time adaptability, multilingual data handling, misinformation, and public health policy alignment. To address these gaps, we propose an integrated, real-time adaptable LLM-based epidemic intelligence system, capable of correlating cross-source data, optimizing healthcare resource allocation, and supporting informed outbreak response. This approach aims to significantly improve early warning capabilities, enhancing forecasting accuracy, and strengthen pandemic preparedness.;10.3389/frai.2025.1645467

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence system using chest x-rays and clinical data to predict disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective study in multiple hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and Brown University affiliated hospitals in Providence, RI, USA. Patients who presented to a hospital in the University of Pennsylvania Health System via the emergency department, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and with an available chest x-ray from their initial presentation or admission, were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (7:1:2). Using the chest x-rays as input to an EfficientNet deep neural network and clinical data, models were trained to predict the binary outcome of disease severity (ie, critical or non-critical). The deep-learning features extracted from the model and clinical data were used to build time-to-event models to predict the risk of disease progression. The models were externally tested on patients who presented to an independent multicentre institution, Brown University affiliated hospitals, and compared with severity scores provided by radiologists. FINDINGS: 1834 patients who presented via the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 9 and July 20, 2020, were identified and assigned to the model training (n=1285), validation (n=183), or testing (n=366) sets. 475 patients who presented via the Brown University affiliated hospitals between March 1 and July 18, 2020, were identified for external testing of the models. When chest x-rays were added to clinical data for severity prediction, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) increased from 0·821 (95% CI 0·796-0·828) to 0·846 (0·815-0·852; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·731 (0·712-0·738) to 0·792 (0·780-0 ·803; p<0·0001) on external testing. When deep-learning features were added to clinical data for progression prediction, the concordance index (C-index) increased from 0·769 (0·755-0·786) to 0·805 (0·800-0·820; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·707 (0·695-0·729) to 0·752 (0·739-0·764; p<0·0001) on external testing. The image and clinical data combined model had significantly better prognostic performance than combined severity scores and clinical data on internal testing (C-index 0·805 vs 0·781; p=0·0002) and external testing (C-index 0·752 vs 0·715; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19, artificial intelligence based on chest x-rays had better prognostic performance than clinical data or radiologist-derived severity scores. Using artificial intelligence, chest x-rays can augment clinical data in predicting the risk of progression to critical illness in patients with COVID-19.

We have developed a portable, low-cost digital microscope scanner, capable of both brightfield and fluorescence imaging. Here, we used the instrument to digitize blood smears, and applied deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect Plasmodium falciparum parasites. METHODS: Thin blood smears (n = 125) were collected from patients with microscopy-confirmed P. falciparum infections in rural Tanzania, prior to and after initiation of artemisinin-based combination therapy. The samples were stained using the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorogen and digitized using the prototype microscope scanner. Two DL algorithms were trained to detect malaria parasites in the samples, and results compared to the visual assessment of both the digitized samples, and the Giemsa-stained thick smears. RESULTS: Detection of P. falciparum parasites in the digitized thin blood smears was possible both by visual assessment and by DL-based analysis with a strong correlation in results (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). A moderately strong correlation was observed between the DL-based thin smear analysis and the visual thick smear-analysis (r = 0.74, p < 0.01). Low levels of parasites were detected by DL-based analysis on day three following treatment initiation, but a small number of fluorescent signals were detected also in microscopy-negative samples. CONCLUSION: Quantification of P. falciparum parasites in DAPI-stained thin smears is feasible using DL-supported, point-of-care digital microscopy, with a high correlation to visual assessment of samples. Fluorescent signals from artefacts in samples with low infection levels represented the main challenge for the digital analysis, thus highlighting the importance of minimizing sample contaminations. The proposed method could support malaria diagnostics and monitoring of treatment response through automated quantification of parasitaemia and is likely to be applicable also for diagnostics of other Plasmodium species and other infectious diseases.;10.1371/journal.pone.0242355

Early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis, which is critical in reducing mortality, is challenging as many of its signs and symptoms are similar to other less critical conditions. We develop an artificial intelligence algorithm, SERA algorithm, which uses both structured data and unstructured clinical notes to predict and diagnose sepsis. We test this algorithm with independent, clinical notes and achieve high predictive accuracy 12 hours before the onset of sepsis (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.87). We compare the SERA algorithm against physician predictions and show the algorithm's potential to increase the early detection of sepsis by up to 32% and reduce false positives by up to 17%. Mining unstructured clinical notes is shown to improve the algorithm's accuracy compared to using only clinical measures for early warning 12 to 48 hours before the onset of sepsis.;10.1038/s41467-021-20910-4

Within the United States, various sociodemographic factors have played a role in the creation of regional disparities. Regional disparities have resulted in the unequal spread of disease between US counties, underscoring the need for efficient and accurate predictive modeling strategies to inform public health officials and reduce the burden on health care systems. Furthermore, despite the widespread accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines across the United States, vaccination rates have become stagnant, necessitating predictive modeling to identify important factors impacting vaccination uptake. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and vaccine uptake across counties in the United States. METHODS: Sociodemographic data on fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were sourced from several online databases such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Census Bureau COVID-19 Site. Machine learning analysis was performed using XGBoost and sociodemographic data. RESULTS: Our model predicted COVID-19 vaccination uptake across US counties with 62% accuracy. In addition, it identified location, education, ethnicity, income, and household access to the internet as the most critical sociodemographic features in predicting vaccination uptake in US counties. Lastly, the model produced a choropleth demonstrating areas of low and high vaccination rates, which can be used by health care authorities in future pandemics to visualize and prioritize areas of low vaccination and design targeted vaccination campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that sociodemographic characteristics are predictors of vaccine uptake rates across counties in the United States and, if leveraged appropriately, can assist policy makers and public health officials to understand vaccine uptake rates and craft policies to improve them.;10.2196/33231

CT-BERT is specifically designed to be used on COVID-19 content, particularly from social media, and can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks such as classification, question-answering, and chatbots. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of CT-BERT on different classification datasets and compare it with BERT-LARGE, its base model. METHODS: The study utilizes CT-BERT, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of COVID-19 related Twitter messages. The authors evaluated the performance of CT-BERT on five different classification datasets, including one in the target domain. The model's performance is compared to its base model, BERT-LARGE, to measure the marginal improvement. The authors also provide detailed information on the training process and the technical specifications of the model. RESULTS: The results indicate that CT-BERT outperforms BERT-LARGE with a marginal improvement of 10-30% on all five classification datasets. The largest improvements are observed in the target domain. The authors provide detailed performance metrics and discuss the significance of these results. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained transformer models, such as CT-BERT, for COVID-19 related natural language processing tasks. The results indicate that CT-BERT can improve the classification performance on COVID-19 related content, especially on social media. These findings have important implications for various applications, such as monitoring public sentiment and developing chatbots to provide COVID-19 related information. The study also highlights the importance of using domain-specific pre-trained models for specific natural language processing tasks.

Fortunately, the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines provided a glimmer of hope and a pathway to recovery. However, owing to misinformation being spread on social media and other platforms, there has been a rise in vaccine hesitancy which can lead to a negative impact on vaccine uptake in the population. The goal of this research is to introduce a novel machine learning-based COVID-19 vaccine misinformation detection framework. STUDY DESIGN: We collected and annotated COVID-19 vaccine tweets and trained machine learning algorithms to classify vaccine misinformation. METHODS: More than 15,000 tweets were annotated as misinformation or general vaccine tweets using reliable sources and validated by medical experts. The classification models explored were XGBoost, LSTM, and BERT transformer model. RESULTS: The best classification performance was obtained using BERT, resulting in 0.98 F1-score on the test set. The precision and recall scores were 0.97 and 0.98, respectively.

Thus, it is critical to detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with fact-checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE), and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition. Our results provided good implications for detecting misinformation about COVID-19 and improving public trust.";10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102569

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records to predict detailed outcomes for an individual. However, the potential of AI has not yet been fully investigated at scale. Here, we modify the GPT (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the temporal progression and competing nature of human diseases in a population scale cohort. We train this model, termed Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million participants of the UK Biobank and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 different ICD-10 coded diseases and death, conditional on each individual's past disease history, age, sex and baseline lifestyle information, and with accuracy comparable to existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling future health trajectories at any point within an individual’s life course with outcomes across the entire disease spectrum. Sampled health trajectories provide meaningful estimates of future disease burden for up to 20 years and enable training AI models which have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods provide insights into Delphi-2M’s predictions, revealing temporal clusters of co-morbidities within and across different disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on the future health course. These analyses, however, also reveal that biases underlying the available training data, which in the case of the UK Biobank stem from distinct healthcare sources, are learned and highlighted. In summary, GPT-based models appear well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population scale health data sets and provide insights into the temporal dependencies of past events that shape future health, impacting our ability to obtain an instantaneous view of personalised health state.;10.1101/2024.06.07.24308553

The objective of this scoping review was to identify the key use cases for involving AI for pandemic preparedness and response from the peer-reviewed, preprint, and grey literature. The data synthesis had two parts: an in-depth review of studies that leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques and a limited review of studies that applied traditional modeling approaches. ML applications from the in-depth review were categorized into use cases related to public health and clinical practice, and narratively synthesized. One hundred eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria for the in-depth review. Six key use cases were identified: forecasting infectious disease dynamics and effects of interventions; surveillance and outbreak detection; real-time monitoring of adherence to public health recommendations; real-time detection of influenza-like illness; triage and timely diagnosis of infections; and prognosis of illness and response to treatment. Data sources and types of ML that were useful varied by use case. The search identified 1167 articles that reported on traditional modeling approaches, which highlighted additional areas where ML could be leveraged for improving the accuracy of estimations or projections. Important ML-based solutions have been developed in response to pandemics, and particularly for COVID-19 but few were optimized for practical application early in the pandemic. These findings can support policymakers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in prioritizing research and development to support operationalization of AI for future pandemics.";10.1038/s41746-021-00459-8

The study provides an insightful overview of the promising prospects and intricate challenges associated with harnessing AI’s capabilities for the early identification and effective management of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases remain a pressing global concern, often necessitating rapid and accurate detection to mitigate their impact. The integration of AI offers a paradigm shift in disease surveillance, enabling the real-time analysis of diverse data streams encompassing clinical records, genomic sequences, social media trends, and environmental factors. Through intricate pattern recognition and predictive modeling, AI holds the potential to expedite outbreak identification, trace transmission pathways, and forecast disease dynamics, facilitating proactive public health interventions. Nevertheless, the voyage towards seamless AI-driven infectious disease detection is accompanied by multifaceted challenges. Data heterogeneity, availability, and quality emerge as foundational obstacles, demanding comprehensive strategies for data aggregation, curation, and sharing. Furthermore, the deployment of AI models mandates a balance between complexity and interpretability, necessitating the development of algorithms that not only excel in performance but also afford clear insights into decision-making processes. Ethical dimensions also loom large in this landscape, with privacy concerns and algorithmic biases necessitating careful consideration. The quest for equitable AI-driven detection mandates the navigation of ethical frameworks that prioritize patient confidentiality, informed consent, and the mitigation of algorithmic biases that may disproportionately impact marginalized populations.;10.1007/978-3-031-59967-5_1

One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation.

Despite this resurgence, measles outbreaks are still rare events that are difficult to predict. Improved methods to predict outbreaks at the county level would facilitate the optimal allocation of public health resources. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate and compare extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and logistic regression, 2 supervised learning approaches, to predict the US counties most likely to experience measles cases. We also aimed to assess the performance of hybrid versions of these models that incorporated additional predictors generated by 2 clustering algorithms, hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) and unsupervised random forest (uRF). METHODS: We constructed a supervised machine learning model based on XGBoost and unsupervised models based on HDBSCAN and uRF. The unsupervised models were used to investigate clustering patterns among counties with measles outbreaks; these clustering data were also incorporated into hybrid XGBoost models as additional input variables. The machine learning models were then compared to logistic regression models with and without input from the unsupervised models. RESULTS: Both HDBSCAN and uRF identified clusters that included a high percentage of counties with measles outbreaks. XGBoost and XGBoost hybrid models outperformed logistic regression and logistic regression hybrid models, with the area under the receiver operating curve values of 0.920-0.926 versus 0.900-0.908, the area under the precision-recall curve values of 0.522-0.532 versus 0.485-0.513, and F(2) scores of 0.595-0.601 versus 0.385-0.426. Logistic regression or logistic regression hybrid models had higher sensitivity than XGBoost or XGBoost hybrid models (0.837-0.857 vs 0.704-0.735) but a lower positive predictive value (0.122-0.141 vs 0.340-0.367) and specificity (0.793-0.821 vs 0.952-0.958). The hybrid versions of the logistic regression and XGBoost models had slightly higher areas under the precision-recall curve, specificity, and positive predictive values than the respective models that did not include any unsupervised features. CONCLUSIONS: XGBoost provided more accurate predictions of measles cases at the county level compared with logistic regression. The threshold of prediction in this model can be adjusted to align with each county's resources, priorities, and risk for measles. While clustering pattern data from unsupervised machine learning approaches improved some aspects of model performance in this imbalanced data set, the optimal approach for the integration of such approaches with supervised machine learning models requires further investigation.";10.2196/42832

Building on this past work, the present study will explore whether providing reasons that patients are considered high risk for flu complications (a) further increases the likelihood they will receive flu vaccine and (b) decreases the likelihood that they receive diagnoses of flu and/or flu-like symptoms in the ensuing flu season. It will also examine whether informing patients that their high-risk status was determined by analyzing their medical records or by an artificial intelligence (AI) / machine-learning (ML) algorithm analyzing their medical records will affect the likelihood of receiving the flu vaccine or diagnoses of flu and/or flu-like symptoms.;

Since numbers of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-?-producing T cells are highly correlated with active TB, we hypothesized that detecting IFN-?- and/or TNF-?-producing T cells would overcome this limitation of IGRA. This study evaluated the diagnostic performances of the IFN-? and TNF-? dual release fluorospot assay for active TB. METHODS: Adult patients with suspected TB including recent TB exposers were prospectively enrolled over a 28-month period. In addition to the conventional IGRA test (i.e. QuantiFERON-In-Tube), a fluorospot assay for detecting IFN-?- and TNF-?-producing T cells was performed. The final diagnoses were classified by clinical category. Patients with confirmed or probable TB were regarded as active TB, and patients with not active TB were further classified as having not active TB with and without LTBI, based on the QuantiFERON-In-Tube results. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients including 45 with active TB and 108 with not active TB (38 LTBI vs. 70 not LTBI) were finally analysed. The sensitivity and specificity of the QuantiFERON-In-Tube assay for active TB were 84% (95% confidence interval (CI), 70-93) and 70% (95% CI 61-79), respectively. The IFN-?/TNF-? dual release assay by fluorospot had substantially higher diagnostic specificity (94%) for diagnosing active TB than the IFN-? single release assay (72%, p < 0.001), without compromising sensitivity (84% vs. 89%, p 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The fluorospot-based IFN-?/TNF-? dual release assay appears to be a simple and useful test for diagnosing active TB.;10.1016/j.cmi.2019.11.003

Meaningful early warning systems with adequate lead times (weeks to months) are needed to guide public health decision–making and enhance community resilience against health threats posed by climate change. Toward this goal, we trained various machine-learning models to predict diarrhoeal disease rates in Nepal (2002–2014), Taiwan (2008–2019), and Vietnam (2000–2015) using temperature, precipitation, previous disease rates, and El Niño Southern Oscillation phases. We also compared the performance of shallow time-series neural network (NN), Random Forest Regressor, artificial nn, gradient boosting regressor, and long short-term memory–based methods for their effectiveness in predicting diarrhoeal disease burden across multiple countries. We evaluated model performance using a test dataset and assessed the accuracy of predicted diarrhoeal disease incidence rates for the last year of available data in each district. Our results suggest that even in the absence of the most recent disease surveillance data, a likely scenario in most low- and middle-income countries, our NN-based early warning system using historical data performs reasonably well. However, future studies are needed to perform prospective evaluations of such early warning systems in real-world settings.;10.1088/1748-9326/ad8366

In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.;10.1038/nature07634

However, this test can take up to 2?d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.;10.1038/s41591-020-0931-3

Accurate diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases—centered around the identification of biomarkers and the elucidation of disease mechanisms—are in dire need of more versatile and practical analytical approaches. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based molecular profiling methods can deliver a wealth of information on a range of functional molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. While MS-driven omics analyses can yield vast datasets, the sheer complexity and multi-dimensionality of MS data can significantly hinder the identification and characterization of functional molecules within specific biological processes and events. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a potent complementary tool that can substantially enhance the processing and interpretation of MS data. AI applications in this context lead to the reduction of spurious signals, the improvement of precision, the creation of standardized analytical frameworks, and the increase of data integration efficiency. This critical review emphasizes the pivotal roles of MS based omics strategies in the discovery of biomarkers and the clarification of infectious diseases. Additionally, the review underscores the transformative ability of AI techniques to enhance the utility of MS-based molecular profiling in the field of infectious diseases by refining the quality and practicality of data produced from omics analyses. In conclusion, we advocate for a forward-looking strategy that integrates AI with MS-based molecular profiling. This integration aims to transform the analytical landscape and the performance of biological molecule characterization, potentially down to the single-cell level.

This paper reviewed research articles for recent machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied to infectious disease diagnosis. We searched the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer, and IEEE databases from 2015 to 2022, identified the pros and cons of the reviewed ML models, and discussed the possible recommendations to advance the studies in this field. We found that most of the articles used small datasets, and few of them used real-time data. Our results demonstrated that a suitable ML technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the desired goal. Moreover, heterogeneous data could ensure the model's generalization, while big data, many features, and a hybrid model will increase the resulting performance. Furthermore, using other techniques such as deep learning and NLP to extract vast features from unstructured data is a powerful approach to enhancing the performance of ML diagnostic models.;10.1155/2022/6902321

Materials and Methods Four deidentified HIPAA-compliant datasets were used in this study that were exempted from review by the institutional review board, which consisted of 1007 posteroanterior chest radiographs. The datasets were split into training (68.0%), validation (17.1%), and test (14.9%). Two different DCNNs, AlexNet and GoogLeNet, were used to classify the images as having manifestations of pulmonary TB or as healthy. Both untrained and pretrained networks on ImageNet were used, and augmentation with multiple preprocessing techniques. Ensembles were performed on the best-performing algorithms. For cases where the classifiers were in disagreement, an independent board-certified cardiothoracic radiologist blindly interpreted the images to evaluate a potential radiologist-augmented workflow. Receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess model performance by using the DeLong method for statistical comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The best-performing classifier had an AUC of 0.99, which was an ensemble of the AlexNet and GoogLeNet DCNNs. The AUCs of the pretrained models were greater than that of the untrained models (P < .001). Augmenting the dataset further increased accuracy (P values for AlexNet and GoogLeNet were .03 and .02, respectively). The DCNNs had disagreement in 13 of the 150 test cases, which were blindly reviewed by a cardiothoracic radiologist, who correctly interpreted all 13 cases (100%). This radiologist-augmented approach resulted in a sensitivity of 97.3% and specificity 100%. Conclusion Deep learning with DCNNs can accurately classify TB at chest radiography with an AUC of 0.99. A radiologist-augmented approach for cases where there was disagreement among the classifiers further improved accuracy. (©) RSNA, 2017.;10.1148/radiol.2017162326

However, accurately predicting severe illness in COVID-19 patients remains challenging, lacking precise methods. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to leverage clinical real-world data and multiple machine-learning algorithms to formulate innovative predictive models for assessing the risk of severe outcomes or mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database (TMUCRD) including electronic health records from three Taiwanese hospitals in Taiwan. This study included patients admitted to the hospitals who received an initial diagnosis of COVID-19 between January 1, 2021, and May 31, 2022. The primary outcome was defined as the composite of severe infection, including ventilator use, intubation, ICU admission, and mortality. Secondary outcomes consisted of individual indicators. The dataset encompassed demographic data, health status, COVID-19 specifics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Two modes (full mode and simplified mode) are used; the former includes all features, and the latter only includes the 30 most important features selected based on the algorithm used by the best model in full mode. Seven machine learning was employed algorithms the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: The study encompassed 22,192 eligible in-patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In the full mode, the model using the light gradient boosting machine algorithm achieved the highest AUROC value (0.939), with an accuracy of 85.5%, a sensitivity of 0.897, and a specificity of 0.853. Age, vaccination status, neutrophil count, sodium levels, and platelet count were significant features. In the simplified mode, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm yielded an AUROC of 0.935, an accuracy of 89.9%, a sensitivity of 0.843, and a specificity of 0.902. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the feasibility of constructing precise predictive models for severe outcomes or mortality in COVID-19 patients by leveraging significant predictors and advanced machine learning. These findings can aid healthcare practitioners in proactively predicting and monitoring severe outcomes or mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, improving treatment and resource allocation.";10.3389/fmed.2023.1289968

Articles without a full text available in the English language were excluded. DATA SOURCES: Articles recorded in Ovid MEDLINE from 01/01/2019 to 22/08/2022 were screened. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted information on data sources, AI models, and epidemiological aspects of retrieved studies. BIAS ASSESSMENT: A bias assessment of AI models was done using PROBAST. PARTICIPANTS: Patients tested positive for COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 39 studies related to AI-based prediction of hospitalization and death related to COVID-19. The articles were published in the period 2019-2022, and mostly used Random Forest as the model with the best performance. AI models were trained using cohorts of individuals sampled from populations of European and non-European countries, mostly with cohort sample size <5,000. Data collection generally included information on demographics, clinical records, laboratory results, and pharmacological treatments (i.e., high-dimensional datasets). In most studies, the models were internally validated with cross-validation, but the majority of studies lacked external validation and calibration. Covariates were not prioritized using ensemble approaches in most of the studies, however, models still showed moderately good performances with Area under the Receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) values >0.7. According to the assessment with PROBAST, all models had a high risk of bias and/or concern regarding applicability.

METHODS: We labeled all 925 patients from four centers with weak and strong infectivity based on multiple sputum smears within a month for our deep-learning model named TBINet's training. We compared TBINet's performance in identifying infectious patients to that of the conventional 3D ResNet model. For model explainability, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technology to identify the site of lesion activation in the CT images. RESULTS: The TBINet model demonstrated superior performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.819 and 0.753 on the validation and external test sets, respectively, compared to existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, using Grad-CAM, we observed that CT images with higher levels of consolidation, voids, upper lobe involvement, and enlarged lymph nodes were more likely to come from patients with highly infectious forms of PTB. CONCLUSION: Our study proves the feasibility of using CT images to identify the infectivity of PTB patients based on the deep learning method.;10.3389/fpubh.2023.1247141

METHOD: We employed linked data from the national health registries of Sweden and Norway to conduct our study. We focused on individuals in Sweden with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection through RT-PCR testing up to August 2022 as our study cohort. Within this group, we identified hospitalized cases as those who were admitted to the hospital within 14?days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and matched them with five controls from the same cohort who were not hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we identified individuals who died within 30?days after being hospitalized for COVID-19. To develop our disease risk scores, we considered various factors, including demographics, infectious, somatic, and mental health conditions, recorded diagnoses, and pharmacological treatments. We also conducted age-specific analyses and assessed model performance through 5-fold cross-validation. Finally, we performed external validation using data from the Norwegian population with COVID-19 up to December 2021. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 124,560 individuals in Sweden were hospitalized, and 15,877 individuals died within 30?days following COVID-19 hospitalization. Disease risk scores for both hospitalization and mortality demonstrated predictive capabilities with ROC-AUC values of 0.70 and 0.72, respectively, across the entire study period. Notably, these scores exhibited a positive correlation with the likelihood of hospitalization or death. In the external validation using data from the Norwegian COVID-19 population (consisting of 53,744 individuals), the disease risk score predicted hospitalization with an AUC of 0.47 and death with an AUC of 0.74. CONCLUSION: The disease risk score showed moderately good performance to predict COVID-19-related mortality but performed poorly in predicting hospitalization when externally validated.;10.3389/fpubh.2023.1258840

Loureiro";The potential role of artificial intelligence in the clinical management of Hansen's disease (leprosy);Front Med (Lausanne);2024;11;;1338598;Missed and delayed diagnoses of Hansen's disease (HD) are making the battle against it even more complex, increasing its transmission and significantly impacting those affected and their families. This strains public health systems and raises the risk of lifelong impairments and disabilities. Worryingly, the three countries most affected by HD witnessed a growth in new cases in 2022, jeopardizing the World Health Organization's targets to interrupt transmission. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help address these challenges by offering the potential for rapid case detection, customized treatment, and solutions for accessibility challenges-especially in regions with a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This perspective article explores how AI can significantly impact the clinical management of HD, focusing on therapeutic strategies. AI can help classify cases, ensure multidrug therapy compliance, monitor geographical treatment coverage, and detect adverse drug reactions and antimicrobial resistance. In addition, AI can assist in the early detection of nerve damage, which aids in disability prevention and planning rehabilitation. Incorporating AI into mental health counseling is also a promising contribution to combating the stigma associated with HD. By revolutionizing therapeutic approaches, AI offers a holistic solution to reduce the burden of HD and improve patient outcomes.;10.3389/fmed.2024.1338598

The severity and high mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with various demographic characteristics and clinical manifestations. Prediction of mortality rate, identification of risk factors, and classification of patients played a crucial role in managing COVID-19 patients. Our purpose was to develop machine learning (ML)-based models for the prediction of mortality and severity among patients with COVID-19. Identifying the most important predictors and unraveling their relationships by classification of patients to the low-, moderate- and high-risk groups might guide prioritizing treatment decisions and a better understanding of interactions between factors. A detailed evaluation of patient data is believed to be important since COVID-19 resurgence is underway in many countries. RESULTS: The findings of this study revealed that the ML-based statistically inspired modification of the partial least square (SIMPLS) method could predict the in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. The prediction model was developed using 19 predictors including clinical variables, comorbidities, and blood markers with moderate predictability (Q(2) = 0.24) to separate survivors and non-survivors. Oxygen saturation level, loss of consciousness, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were the top mortality predictors. Correlation analysis showed different correlation patterns among predictors for each non-survivor and survivor cohort separately. The main prediction model was verified using other ML-based analyses with a high area under the curve (AUC) (0.81-0.93) and specificity (0.94-0.99). The obtained data revealed that the mortality prediction model can be different for males and females with diverse predictors. Patients were classified into four clusters of mortality risk and identified the patients at the highest risk of mortality, which accentuated the most significant predictors correlating with mortality. CONCLUSION: An ML model for predicting mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was developed considering the interactions between factors that may reduce the complexity of clinical decision-making processes. The most predictive factors related to patient mortality were identified by assessing and classifying patients into different groups based on their sex and mortality risk (low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups).;10.3389/fmed.2023.1170331

Zrubka";Automation of systematic reviews of biomedical literature: a scoping review of studies indexed in PubMed;Syst Rev;2024;13;1;174;BACKGROUND: The demand for high-quality systematic literature reviews (SRs) for evidence-based medical decision-making is growing. SRs are costly and require the scarce resource of highly skilled reviewers. Automation technology has been proposed to save workload and expedite the SR workflow. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of SR automation studies indexed in PubMed, focusing on the applicability of these technologies in real world practice. METHODS: In November 2022, we extracted, combined, and ran an integrated PubMed search for SRs on SR automation. Full-text English peer-reviewed articles were included if they reported studies on SR automation methods (SSAM), or automated SRs (ASR). Bibliographic analyses and knowledge-discovery studies were excluded. Record screening was performed by single reviewers, and the selection of full text papers was performed in duplicate. We summarized the publication details, automated review stages, automation goals, applied tools, data sources, methods, results, and Google Scholar citations of SR automation studies. RESULTS: From 5321 records screened by title and abstract, we included 123 full text articles, of which 108 were SSAM and 15 ASR. Automation was applied for search (19/123, 15.4%), record screening (89/123, 72.4%), full-text selection (6/123, 4.9%), data extraction (13/123, 10.6%), risk of bias assessment (9/123, 7.3%), evidence synthesis (2/123, 1.6%), assessment of evidence quality (2/123, 1.6%), and reporting (2/123, 1.6%). Multiple SR stages were automated by 11 (8.9%) studies. The performance of automated record screening varied largely across SR topics. In published ASR, we found examples of automated search, record screening, full-text selection, and data extraction. In some ASRs, automation fully complemented manual reviews to increase sensitivity rather than to save workload. Reporting of automation details was often incomplete in ASRs. CONCLUSIONS: Automation techniques are being developed for all SR stages, but with limited real-world adoption. Most SR automation tools target single SR stages, with modest time savings for the entire SR process and varying sensitivity and specificity across studies. Therefore, the real-world benefits of SR automation remain uncertain. Standardizing the terminology, reporting, and metrics of study reports could enhance the adoption of SR automation techniques in real-world practice.;10.1186/s13643-024-02592-3

Wallace";Toward systematic review automation: a practical guide to using machine learning tools in research synthesis;Systematic Reviews;2019;8;1;163;Technologies and methods to speed up the production of systematic reviews by reducing the manual labour involved have recently emerged. Automation has been proposed or used to expedite most steps of the systematic review process, including search, screening, and data extraction. However, how these technologies work in practice and when (and when not) to use them is often not clear to practitioners. In this practical guide, we provide an overview of current machine learning methods that have been proposed to expedite evidence synthesis. We also offer guidance on which of these are ready for use, their strengths and weaknesses, and how a systematic review team might go about using them in practice.;10.1186/s13643-019-1074-9

Elicit is one such tool that can generate a summary of the question asked, setting it apart from other AI tools. The aim of this study is to determine whether AI-assisted research using Elicit adds value to the systematic review process compared to traditional screening methods. METHODS: We compare the results from an umbrella review conducted independently of AI with the results of the AI-based searching using the same criteria. Elicit contribution was assessed based on three criteria: repeatability, reliability and accuracy. For repeatability the search process was repeated three times on Elicit (trial 1, trial 2, trial 3). For accuracy, articles obtained with Elicit were reviewed using the same inclusion criteria as the umbrella review. Reliability was assessed by comparing the number of publications with those without AI-based searches. RESULTS: The repeatability test found 246,169 results and 172 results for the trials 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Concerning accuracy, 6 articles were included at the conclusion of the selection process. Regarding, revealed 3 common articles, 3 exclusively identified by Elicit and 17 exclusively identified by the AI-independent umbrella review search. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that AI research assistants, like Elicit, can serve as valuable complementary tools for researchers when designing or writing systematic reviews. However, AI tools have several limitations and should be used with caution. When using AI tools, certain principles must be followed to maintain methodological rigour and integrity. Improving the performance of AI tools such as Elicit and contributing to the development of guidelines for their use during the systematic review process will enhance their effectiveness.;10.1186/s12874-025-02528-y

Doggen; Anke Lenferink";Artificial intelligence in systematic reviews: promising when appropriately used;BMJ Open;2023;13;7;e072254;Background Systematic reviews provide a structured overview of the available evidence in medical-scientific research. However, due to the increasing medical-scientific research output, it is a time-consuming task to conduct systematic reviews. To accelerate this process, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in the review process. In this communication paper, we suggest how to conduct a transparent and reliable systematic review using the AI tool ‘ASReview’ in the title and abstract screening.Methods Use of the AI tool consisted of several steps. First, the tool required training of its algorithm with several prelabelled articles prior to screening. Next, using a researcher-in-the-loop algorithm, the AI tool proposed the article with the highest probability of being relevant. The reviewer then decided on relevancy of each article proposed. This process was continued until the stopping criterion was reached. All articles labelled relevant by the reviewer were screened on full text.Results Considerations to ensure methodological quality when using AI in systematic reviews included: the choice of whether to use AI, the need of both deduplication and checking for inter-reviewer agreement, how to choose a stopping criterion and the quality of reporting. Using the tool in our review resulted in much time saved: only 23% of the articles were assessed by the reviewer.Conclusion The AI tool is a promising innovation for the current systematic reviewing practice, as long as it is appropriately used and methodological quality can be assured.PROSPERO registration number CRD42022283952.;10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072254

This review delineated automated tools and platforms that employ artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and evaluated the reported benefits and challenges in using such methods. A search was conducted in 4 databases (Medline, Embase, CDSR, and Epistemonikos) up to April 2021 for systematic reviews and other related reviews implementing AI methods. To be included, the review must use any form of AI method, including machine learning, deep learning, neural network, or any other applications used to enable the full or semi-autonomous performance of one or more stages in the development of evidence synthesis. Twelve reviews were included, using nine different tools to implement 15 different AI methods. Eleven methods were used in the screening stages of the review (73%). The rest were divided: two in data extraction (13%) and two in risk of bias assessment (13%). The ambiguous benefits of the data extractions, combined with the reported advantages from 10 reviews, indicating that AI platforms have taken hold with varying success in evidence synthesis. However, the results are qualified by the reliance on the self-reporting of the review authors. Extensive human validation still appears required at this stage in implementing AI methods, though further evaluation is required to define the overall contribution of such platforms in enhancing efficiency and quality in evidence synthesis.;10.1002/jrsm.1553

Disaster medicine (DM) has recently gained prominence as a critical issue due to the high frequency of worldwide disasters, especially in 2021. The new artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technologies and concepts have recently progressed in DM education. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to familiarize the reader with the remote technologies that have been developed and used in DM education over the past 20 years. LITERATURE SCOPING REVIEWS: Mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, deep learning (DL), and visual reality stimulation, e.g., head-mounted display (HMD), are selected as promising and inspiring designs in DM education. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on the remote technologies applied in DM pedagogy for medical, nursing, and social work, as well as other health discipline students, e.g., paramedics. Databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), ISI Web of Science (WOS), EBSCO (EBSCO Essentials), Embase (EMB), and Scopus were used. The sourced results were recorded in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart and followed in accordance with the PRISMA extension Scoping Review checklist. We included peer-reviewed articles, Epubs (electronic publications such as databases), and proceedings written in English. VOSviewer for related keywords extracted from review articles presented as a tabular summary to demonstrate their occurrence and connections among these DM education articles from 2000 to 2022. RESULTS: A total of 1,080 research articles on remote technologies in DM were initially reviewed. After exclusion, 64 articles were included in our review. Emergency remote teaching/learning education, remote learning, online learning/teaching, and blended learning are the most frequently used keywords. As new remote technologies used in emergencies become more advanced, DM pedagogy is facing more complex problems. DISCUSSIONS: Artificial intelligence-enhanced remote technologies promote learning incentives for medical undergraduate students or graduate professionals, but the efficacy of learning quality remains uncertain. More blended AI-modulating pedagogies in DM education could be increasingly important in the future. More sophisticated evaluation and assessment are needed to implement carefully considered designs for effective DM education.;10.3389/fpubh.2023.1029558

AI methods demonstrated good performance in all studies: mean accuracy=91.93% (SD 8.10%, 95% CI 90.52%-93.33%; median 93.59%, IQR 88.33%-98.32%), mean area under the curve (AUC)=93.48% (SD 7.51%, 95% CI 91.90%-95.06%; median 95.28%, IQR 91%-99%), mean sensitivity=92.77% (SD 7.48%, 95% CI 91.38%-94.15%; median 94.05% IQR 89%-98.87%), and mean specificity=92.39% (SD 9.4%, 95% CI 90.30%-94.49%; median 95.38%, IQR 89.42%-99.19%). AI performance across different biomarker types showed mean accuracies of 92.45% (SD 7.83%), 89.03% (SD 8.49%), and 84.21% (SD 0%); mean AUCs of 94.47% (SD 7.32%), 88.45% (SD 8.33%), and 88.61% (SD 5.9%); mean sensitivities of 93.8% (SD 6.27%), 88.41% (SD 10.24%), and 93% (SD 0%); and mean specificities of 94.2% (SD 6.63%), 85.89% (SD 14.66%), and 95% (SD 0%) for radiographic, molecular/biochemical, and physiological types, respectively. AI performance across various reference standards showed mean accuracies of 91.44% (SD 7.3%), 93.16% (SD 6.44%), and 88.98% (SD 9.77%); mean AUCs of 90.95% (SD 7.58%), 94.89% (SD 5.18%), and 92.61% (SD 6.01%); mean sensitivities of 91.76% (SD 7.02%), 93.73% (SD 6.67%), and 91.34% (SD 7.71%); and mean specificities of 86.56% (SD 12.8%), 93.69% (SD 8.45%), and 92.7% (SD 6.54%) for bacteriological, human reader, and combined reference standards, respectively. The transfer learning (TL) approach showed increasing popularity (n=89, 58.6%). Notably, only 1 (0.7%) study conducted domain-shift analysis for TB detection. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review underscore the considerable promise of AI-based methods in the realm of TB detection. Future research endeavors should prioritize conducting domain-shift analyses to better simulate real-world scenarios in TB detection.

"Z. Liao; P. Lan; X. Fan; B. Kelly; A. Innes; Z. Liao";SIRVD-DL: A COVID-19 deep learning prediction model based on time-dependent SIRVD;Comput Biol Med;2021;138;;104868;COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges that human beings have faced recently. Many researchers have proposed different prediction methods for establishing a virus transmission model and predicting the trend of COVID-19. Among them, the methods based on artificial intelligence are currently the most interesting and widely used. However, only using artificial intelligence methods for prediction cannot capture the time change pattern of the transmission of infectious diseases. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a COVID-19 prediction model based on time-dependent SIRVD by using deep learning. This model combines deep learning technology with the mathematical model of infectious diseases, and forecasts the parameters in the mathematical model of infectious diseases by fusing deep learning models such as LSTM and other time prediction methods. In the current situation of mass vaccination, we analyzed COVID-19 data from January 15, 2021, to May 27, 2021 in seven countries - India, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. The experimental results show that the prediction model not only has a 50% improvement in single-day predictions compared to pure deep learning methods, but also can be adapted to short- and medium-term predictions, which makes the overall prediction more interpretable and robust.;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104868

OBJECTIVES: We summarise recent and potential future applications of AI and its relevance to clinical infection practice. METHODS: 1617 PubMed results were screened, with priority given to clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This narrative review focusses on studies using prospectively collected real-world data with clinical validation, and on research with translational potential, such as novel drug discovery and microbiome-based interventions. RESULTS: There is some evidence of clinical utility of AI applied to laboratory diagnostics (e.g. digital culture plate reading, malaria diagnosis, antimicrobial resistance profiling), clinical imaging analysis (e.g. pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis), clinical decision support tools (e.g. sepsis prediction, antimicrobial prescribing) and public health outbreak management (e.g. COVID-19). Most studies to date lack any real-world validation or clinical utility metrics. Significant heterogeneity in study design and reporting limits comparability. Many practical and ethical issues exist, including algorithm transparency and risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in and development of AI-based tools for infection research and management are undoubtedly gaining pace, although the real-world clinical utility to date appears much more modest.;10.1016/j.jinf.2023.07.006

AI has become an essential tool in healthcare, improving diagnosis, treatment, and health system management. Its applications range from disease surveillance to personalized patient care, offering transformative potential in addressing public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapid adoption of AI technologies also raises concerns related to accuracy, bias, ethical dilemmas, and the safety of AI-driven decisions in healthcare. The paper presents a systematic review of the literature, identifying key areas where AI is used in public health, alongside the advantages and potential risks. Additionally, it highlights the importance of the EU AI Act, which categorizes public health AI systems as high-risk, requiring strict oversight to ensure transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights. The Act serves as a critical framework to foster trust and safety in AI applications, ensuring their responsible and ethical use in public health while enhancing Europe's preparedness for future health challenges. Further research is needed to address the limitations and ethical issues associated with AI in public health, including its impact on workforce dynamics and equitable healthcare access.;10.3233/shti250303

We assessed the quality and safety of the management suggested by Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) in real-life practice for patients with positive blood cultures. METHODS: Over a 4-week period in a tertiary care hospital, data from consecutive infectious diseases (ID) consultations for a first positive blood culture were prospectively provided to ChatGPT-4. Data were requested to propose a comprehensive management plan (suspected/confirmed diagnosis, workup, antibiotic therapy, source control, follow-up). We compared the management plan suggested by ChatGPT-4 with the plan suggested by ID consultants based on literature and guidelines. Comparisons were performed by 2 ID physicians not involved in patient management. RESULTS: Forty-four cases with a first episode of positive blood culture were included. ChatGPT-4 provided detailed and well-written responses in all cases. AI's diagnoses were identical to those of the consultant in 26 (59%) cases. Suggested diagnostic workups were satisfactory (ie, no missing important diagnostic tests) in 35 (80%) cases; empirical antimicrobial therapies were adequate in 28 (64%) cases and harmful in 1 (2%). Source control plans were inadequate in 4 (9%) cases. Definitive antibiotic therapies were optimal in 16 (36%) patients and harmful in 2 (5%). Overall, management plans were considered optimal in only 1 patient, as satisfactory in 17 (39%), and as harmful in 7 (16%).

Therefore, in order to successfully face a health emergency, scientific evidence and validated models are needed to provide real-time information that could be applied by any health center, especially for high-risk populations, such as transplant recipients. We have developed a hybrid prediction model whose accuracy relative to several alternative configurations has been validated through a battery of clustering techniques. Using hospital admission data from a cohort of hospitalized transplant patients, our hybrid Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model extrapolates the progression towards severe COVID-19 disease with an accuracy of 96.3%, outperforming any competing model, such as logistic regression (65.5%) and random forest (44.8%). In this regard, DEA-ANN allows us to categorize the evolution of patients through the values of the analyses performed at hospital admission.

Peters";A Natural Language Processing Model for COVID-19 Detection Based on Dutch General Practice Electronic Health Records by Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers: Development and Validation Study;J Med Internet Res;2023;25;;e49944;"BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) models such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) hold promise in revolutionizing disease identification from electronic health records (EHRs) by potentially enhancing efficiency and accuracy. However, their practical application in practice settings demands a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to development and validation. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted challenges in disease identification due to limited testing availability and challenges in handling unstructured data. In the Netherlands, where general practitioners (GPs) serve as the first point of contact for health care, EHRs generated by these primary care providers contain a wealth of potentially valuable information. Nonetheless, the unstructured nature of free-text entries in EHRs poses challenges in identifying trends, detecting disease outbreaks, or accurately pinpointing COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate a BERT model for detecting COVID-19 consultations in general practice EHRs in the Netherlands. METHODS: The BERT model was initially pretrained on Dutch language data and fine-tuned using a comprehensive EHR data set comprising confirmed COVID-19 GP consultations and non-COVID-19-related consultations. The data set was partitioned into a training and development set, and the model's performance was evaluated on an independent test set that served as the primary measure of its effectiveness in COVID-19 detection. To validate the final model, its performance was assessed through 3 approaches. First, external validation was applied on an EHR data set from a different geographic region in the Netherlands. Second, validation was conducted using results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test data obtained from municipal health services. Lastly, correlation between predicted outcomes and COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the Netherlands was assessed, encompassing the period around the outbreak of the pandemic in the Netherlands, that is, the period before widespread testing. RESULTS: The model development used 300,359 GP consultations. We developed a highly accurate model for COVID-19 consultations (accuracy 0.97, F(1)-score 0.90, precision 0.85, recall 0.85, specificity 0.99). External validations showed comparable high performance. Validation on PCR test data showed high recall but low precision and specificity. Validation using hospital data showed significant correlation between COVID-19 predictions of the model and COVID-19-related hospitalizations (F(1)-score 96.8; P<.001; R(2)=0.69). Most importantly, the model was able to predict COVID-19 cases weeks before the first confirmed case in the Netherlands. CONCLUSIONS: The developed BERT model was able to accurately identify COVID-19 cases among GP consultations even preceding confirmed cases. The validated efficacy of our BERT model highlights the potential of NLP models to identify disease outbreaks early, exemplifying the power of multidisciplinary efforts in harnessing technology for disease identification. Moreover, the implications of this study extend beyond COVID-19 and offer a blueprint for the early recognition of various illnesses, revealing that such models could revolutionize disease surveillance.";10.2196/49944

Hassanein";Artificial intelligence in vaccine research and development: an umbrella review;Front Immunol;2025;16;;1567116;"BACKGROUND: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines highlighted the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern vaccinology, accelerating timelines from years to months. Nevertheless, the specific roles and effectiveness of AI in accelerating and enhancing vaccine research, development, distribution, and acceptance remain dispersed across various reviews, underscoring the need for a unified synthesis. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review to consolidate evidence on AI's contributions to vaccine discovery, optimization, clinical testing, supply-chain logistics, and public acceptance. Five databases were systematically searched up to January 2025 for systematic, scoping, narrative, and rapid reviews, as well as meta-analyses explicitly focusing on AI in vaccine contexts. Quality assessments were performed using the ROBIS and AMSTAR 2 tools to evaluate risk of bias and methodological rigor. RESULTS: Among the 27 reviews, traditional machine learning approaches-random forests, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and logistic regression-dominated tasks from antigen discovery and epitope prediction to supply?chain optimization. Deep learning architectures, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and variational autoencoders, proved instrumental in multiepitope vaccine design and adaptive clinical trial simulations. AI?driven multi?omic integration accelerated epitope mapping, shrinking discovery timelines by months, while predictive analytics optimized manufacturing workflows and supply?chain operations (including temperature?controlled, cold?chain"" logistics). Sentiment analysis and conversational AI tools demonstrated promising capabilities for real?time monitoring of public attitudes and tailored communication to address vaccine hesitancy. Nonetheless, persistent challenges emerged-data heterogeneity, algorithmic bias, limited regulatory frameworks, and ethical concerns over transparency and equity. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings illustrate AI's transformative potential across the vaccine lifecycle but underscore that translating promise into practice demands five targeted action areas: robust data governance and multi?omics consortia to harmonize and share high?quality datasets; comprehensive regulatory and ethical frameworks featuring transparent model explainability, standardized performance metrics, and interdisciplinary ethics committees for ongoing oversight; the adoption of adaptive trial designs and manufacturing simulations that enable real?time safety monitoring and in silico process modeling; AI?enhanced public engagement strategies-such as routinely audited chatbots, real?time sentiment dashboards, and culturally tailored messaging-to mitigate vaccine hesitancy; and a concerted focus on global equity and pandemic preparedness through capacity building, digital infrastructure expansion, routine bias audits, and sustained funding in low?resource settings. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review confirms AI's pivotal role in accelerating vaccine development, enhancing efficacy and safety, and bolstering public acceptance. Realizing these benefits requires not only investments in infrastructure and stakeholder engagement but also transparent model documentation, interdisciplinary ethics oversight, and routine algorithmic bias audits. Moreover, bridging the gap from in silico promise to real?world impact demands large?scale validation studies and methods that can accommodate heterogeneous evidence, ensuring AI?driven innovations deliver equitable global health outcomes and reinforce pandemic preparedness.""";10.3389/fimmu.2025.1567116
